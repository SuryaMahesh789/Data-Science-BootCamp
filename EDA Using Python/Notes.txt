# There are many columns which have null values such as date_added, job_type, organization, salary, and sector.
# We cannot predict anything in Machine Learning with the dirty data.
# Before applying any Machine Learning technique, we need to deal with the missing data and outliers.
# There are some columns which are useless and very obvious.
# For example, country, country code, has_expired, and job_board.
# We are analysing this problem for US and Monster.com. And, Has_expired has only one value
# i.e. NO. So there is no point to use these columns further.
